python-musicbrainz 

If you've installed python-musicbrainz before, you will need to remove the
old directory.  With ctypes I only need one file, not a whole directory of
stuff.

This is a straight python to c binding for libmusicbrainz.  It uses ctypes
to avoid having to write c code.  You'll have to get and download the ctypes
module version 0.9.x from http://sf.net/projects/ctypes .

To install:

	python setup.py install

Next check out the "examples" directory to see some examples of using the
module.

The docs for the underlying lib can be found at:
