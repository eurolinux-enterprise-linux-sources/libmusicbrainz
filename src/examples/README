MusicBrainz Client Library Examples:
------------------------------------

For each of these examples, you can set the following enviornment variables:

 MB_SERVER - determines the server name to query
 MB_DEBUG  - set to 1 to print the outgoing and incoming RDF queries
 MB_DEPTH  - set the depth for the query to the server. A higher depth will
             return more information from the server. Please refer to the
             online docs for more details.

Note:

To retrieve a CD using a CD Index Id, use the getalbum program -- it takes album id or
cdindex id arguments.
